# wordfinder

## Prerequisites

These non-core modules must be installed:
* `Mojolicious::Lite`
* `List::MoreUtils`

## How to use

On one terminal, run the web server:
```
$ morbo wordfinder.pl
```

By default, it will run on port 3000 (Mojolicious default). If you want to change it to, say, port 7860:
```
$ morbo -l "http://*:7860" wordfinder.pl
```

Open another terminal, and try these:
* Pinging. This will just return OK (HTTP code 200; content type: `text/plain`):
  ```
  $ curl http://127.0.0.1:7860/ping
  OK
  ```
* Find words in dictionary (the default is `words` in the current directory. Change in `wordfinder.conf`) and get the result as a JSON object (content type: `application/json`; note that the result depends on the content of the dictionary used):
  ```
  $ curl http://127.0.0.1:7860/wordfinder/dgo
  ["D","G","God","O","Od","Og","d","do","dog","g","go","god","o","od"]
  ```

## Docker build
You can use `Dockerfile` and the supporting `cpanfile` for docker build purposes.

When you run the result, the web server will use port 80. You can change this in `Dockerfile`.

### Examples

Building:
```
$ docker build -t adeishs/sd .
```

Running:
```
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 adeishs/sd
```

Testing:
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/ping
OK
$ curlÂ http://localhost:8080/wordfinder/dgo
["D","G","God","O","Od","Og","d","do","dog","g","go","god","o","od"]
```
